## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBNB Data from 2017 to better understand:
1. What is the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
2. What factors contributed to AirBNB price?
3. What locations in Seattle are reviewed more often?
4. What is the busiest time of the year in Seattle?

You can see the analysis here to answer the questions above. 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is a piece of code to obtain the model used to predict price.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/455ec9545fb8/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBNB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
